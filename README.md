Current Status
==============

Currently julia-ao is not being build or developed as a Julia package, but for the long term it will be converted to an installable package.

The development is being started from the Deformable Mirror. The Wavefront Sensors will be added soon, and after that controllers will be added. The focus on those three components is due to the fact that it is being developed as part of a master thesis. The research for this thesis require simulation code for the deformable mirror, a controller and a wavefront sensor. The atmosphere data for the simulation will be generated with other simulators.
